       Hello All! And Welcome to my REACT Portfolio!
       A Little about myself: I have just started my coding career earlier this year. 
       In this coding journey I have learned and practiced a lot of new subjects I never thought of experiencing.
       It has been fun, but more than anything, challenging. I love challenges. Challenges keep me humble, focus, and motivated.
       With that being said, I plan on growing as both a person and proffesional as I continue this coding journey.
       Please Join Me in this coding Journey. Im sure it will be time worthy
